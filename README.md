# django-simple-recaptcha
A Django package that is essentially a fork of [Vitor Freitas']
[simple-recaptcha] repo (licensed under MIT License). Contains a decorator
for use with reCAPTCHA v2. Thanks Vitor!

This package has no tests yetâ€”and therefore, is not production-ready.

Also, reCAPTCHA v3 and invisible reCAPTCHA is not supported yet.
